# Problem Statement:
Design and implement a dynamic web application for any business functionality by using web development technologies.

# Description:
A housing society management project effectively manages and handles all the functioning of a cooperative housing society. The software system can store the data of various flat owners and their family members. The system also maintains the society. The system needs an administrator to input various flat owner data and billing amounts into it.
With more and more people moving towards bigger cities and metros in search of better opportunities, the space to make homes in these areas keeps on decreasing. So instead of making homes, the smarter choice becomes apartment buildings or societies.
With more and more societies being built and more people moving in, a better, computer based database and management system for these societies becomes more of a need than a feature.
Here we have worked towards building a simple yet productive and efficient Society Management System which can perform CRUD operations and with endless future scope of adding features.
This project presents a solution for housing/residential societies to manage their residents with more ease through a computer based approach. Any more features depending on the needs of a society can be easily added. The project gives easy access to CRUD operations and makes it easier for the user to maintain records.
The project is built on JSP and makes use of SQL to maintain its database operations. JDBC (connectivity) makes it possible to edit the database through the UI without the hassle of using cmd lines and SQL queries which the user may not be aware of.
